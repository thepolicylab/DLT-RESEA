Specifically:
* `Appendix_2_Power_Calculation.ipynb` details the power calculations that were used to calculate the Minimum Detectable Effect (or MDE) for key metrics.
* `Appendix_3_Randomization_Code.ipynb` evaluates the randomization scheme provided by the Department of Information Technology (or DoIT), and suggests a workable solution.
